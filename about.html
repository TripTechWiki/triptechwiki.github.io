<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  This is a website, made by a group of 3 (3) people. These three people are both very different and very not different at all. Most if not all of what you read on this about page is written by one of the three people in the fiend group. This is an about page.<br>
  <br>
  Don't forget to come back here frequently, because we will be making consistent updates.<br>
  Oh you wanted to actually know about this website?<br>
  <br>
  This website is a conglomeration of a bunch of group projects and solo projects, and whatever, my best suggestion is to explore, things will connect to each other in unique ways. Pretend like it's an ARG/unfiction thing (it's not LOL!!).<br>
