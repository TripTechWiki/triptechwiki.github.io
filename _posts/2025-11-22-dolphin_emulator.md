So you're tellin' me that I can run any wii game I want from just my computer‽ That's insane!

<!-- excerpt -->

Yeah… I just installed [dolphin emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org), an amazing wii and gamecube emulator, and played [Rhythm Heaven Fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_Heaven_Fever) for like an hour and a half… and it literally worked right out of the box! So many games just waiting to be played… or at least, the ones that don't require pointing. I don't have a wii bar (yet), so I can only play games that only require the wiimote.

I didn't have a wii growing up, so I didn't ever play classics such as Super Mario Galaxy or Donkey Kong Country Returns, but now I can! Potential reviews are on the way…
