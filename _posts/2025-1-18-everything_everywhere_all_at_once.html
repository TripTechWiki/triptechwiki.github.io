<p>Everything Everywhere All at Once has got to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. In fact, after watching it a few days ago I'd say it's easily made it into my top 3 movies, only rivaled by Inception and Interstellar. The pacing is great, the story telling is phenomenal, and the overall message is amazing.</p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<p>In a nutshell, for me this movie expresses how in the infinite sea of branching timeliness that make up our universe, we are utterly and truly insignificant. Once we realize this, however, we have an important choice to make. On one hand, we can choose to seek instant gratification and completely screw everything up, since it won't matter anyways, or we can choose to live our best life at every moment, always trying to make the world a little better. In the grand scheme of things, it's really up to each one of up what choices, and therefore what consquences, make up our life.</p>

<p>I havn't seen a movie with such depth in quite some time, and would highly recommend this movie to everyone.</p>
