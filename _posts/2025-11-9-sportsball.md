Some win, some lose. What more is there to say?

<!-- excerpt -->

Actually though, I've never understood the fascination of team sports. What's the point of rooting for a team that's always changing its players around? I can understand liking specific people, but just liking a team? There's nothing substantial to it!

I'm not against competition, but I think it makes more sense when it's between personalities that can be rooted for individually. For example, I like to watch competitive series on YouTube. Specifically, I like the [Life Series](https://the-life-series.fandom.com/wiki/The_Life_Series_Wiki), [Jet Lag](https://www.youtube.com/c/jetlagthegame), and [Taskmaster](https://www.youtube.com/@Taskmaster), among others. In all of these shows, people may come and go, but that just means that there are different options to root for, since each person is effectively their own team.
