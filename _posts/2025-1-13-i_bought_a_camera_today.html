<p>It was a Christmas gift.</p>

<p>It was 19 days late...</p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<p>Through no fault of the giver.</p>

<p>The camera wasn't actually what I received.</p>

<p>The gift was a little bit of liquidity.</p>

<p>So does that mean the gift was impersonal?</p>

<p>Simply uncaring?</p>

<p>Or was it thoughtful?</p>

<p>Does something seen as being so impersonal become thoughtful if the person knows you two aren't as close as you'd like, so they give you options of your own choosing instead of something likely to be discarded?</p>

<p>Because money, in fact, has many options.</p>

<p>Not all are gifts.</p>

<p>Do you pay a bill?</p>

<p>Do you use it to invest?</p>

<p>Do you buy something fun?</p>

<p>Do you use it to do something fun?</p>

<p>Do you simply buy something to help you along?</p>

<p>I decided to try and buy memories.</p>

<p>Another person's at first, but mine will soon follow.</p>
<br>
<p>I would say it was a good gift.</p>
