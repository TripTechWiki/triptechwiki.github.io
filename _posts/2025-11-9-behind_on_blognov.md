Unfortunately, the astute readers of this miniscule sliver of the internet may have noticed that I effectively failed my self proposed BlogNov challenge by not posting for the past 3 days. This brings great woe to my soul, and weighs heavily on my heart the thought of the disappointment such readers felt while refreshing their pages, checking for new posts, but alas: nothing.

<!-- excerpt -->

Thus, after seconds of careful consideration, I have come to the following conclusion: The BlogNov challenge will no longer be to publish a post every single day (though this will still be the goal), but to publish a post *for* every single day. This means that as long as 30 posts are published in the month of November, albeit some of them delayed, the BlogNov challenge will still have been completed successfully.

After all, what's the point of all this? It's not to set anxiety inducing deadlines or strict rules, the point is simply to [*write something*](/blog/2025/07/05/start_writing.html)!

I hope you all understand! :D
