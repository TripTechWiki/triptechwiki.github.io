<p>The NeverEnding Story is <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhMSGYHoeOU>free on YouTube movies</a> right now!!! As soon as I saw this, I had to watch it.</p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<p>Once I did, I realized how much underlying meaning I had missed when I watched the movie as a wee lad. Amidst all the adventure and intrigue lies an amazing message, reminding us to always be imaginative. This is done through a [spoilers] really cool fourth wall break that I absolutely did not pick up on in my younger days.</p>

<p>On top of all that, the soundtrack is fantastic, and the visuals look quite good given the era they're from! It really reminds me of movies like The Dark Crystal and The Labyrinth, which were produced around the same time.</p>

<p>The NeverEnding Story is certainly worth the watch, especially if you haven't seen it in a while.</p>
