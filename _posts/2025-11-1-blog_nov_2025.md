November has just begun! That means that [Novel November](https://help.prowritingaid.com/article/356-what-is-novel-november) (or NovNov) has just begun as well! NovNov is basically a challenge to write a 50,000 word novel entirely within the month of November, starting at midnight (local time) November 1st, and ending before midnight (local time) December 1st.

<!-- excerpt -->

There's a chance you've heard of this challenge before, but by a different name. That's because for many years it was called [National Novel Writing Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month), or NaNoWriMo. Unfortunately, the non-profit organization that ran NaNoWriMo closed in March earlier this year. ProWritingAid, an AI writing tool company, started NovNov to fill this gap.

I will not be participating in NovNov. 50,000 words is too many, and [Malva Karst](https://malva-karst.neocities.org/writing/nanowrimo) has already told me how hard it is. Instead, I'm taking inspiration from the event and motivating myself to participate in my own event: BlogNov! BlogNov is an event where you publish a blog post every day in November. All text in the post has to have been written in November, so you can start working on daily posts in advance (except for the first one, which I've kinda been planning in my head for a few days). There's no word count (although I'll be putting one at the bottom for fun), and the blog posts don't have to be good. No stress; [just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) [start writing](/blog/2025/07/05/start_writing.html).

A lot of the posts I make for BlogNov may not be that polished, and that's probably because I'm just writing down whatever thoughts I've been having that day or the last few days. Whatever gets thrown on the page I'll be happy with.

The [word counts](https://wordcounter.net) I'll be posting at the bottom of each page only count the words in the actual body of the post, so they won't include the title or the word count words themselves.
