title: Why Watch Movies If You're Not Paying Attention?

On Halloween, I watched [The Sixth Sense](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167404/) with some friends after going to the [Haunted House](/blog/2025/11/02/my_haunted_house_experience.html). That is, emphasis on ***I*** watched The Sixth Sense. Everyone else just looked at their phones the whole time doing who knows what!

<!-- excerpt -->

When we got to the end where everything is wrapped up, everyone (including some who hadn't seen the movie before!) just kinda got up and left! They missed the whole point! The mystery! The build up! The symbolism!! The big reveal!!! All the effort put into the story squandered on their goldfish attention spans!!!!!

If you can't tell, I like to *actually watch* media, *especially* if it's my first time seeing it. Like, try to focus on the details and figure stuff out as I watch. It makes it so much more fun to know the plot points and lore, then talk about it with people afterward!

Thanks for listening to my tiny rant. If you have a habit of multitasking watching shows, maybe try to focus next time you watch something new? Idk but it could be interesting.
