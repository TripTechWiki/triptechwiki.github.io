Well, apparently my 2-week writing phase has come and gone… It's already been a few days since I last wrote anything for the blog, and I feel like I'm already running out of ideas… or at least I don't have nearly as many ideas as when I started this whole thing.

<!-- excerpt -->

To be fair, this month I've already more than doubled the number of posts that were on the site, so maybe I just too big a leap trying to step up production so much in literally zero time.

My goal is still to [publish 30 posts in November](/blog/2025/11/09/behind_on_blognov.html), though! I will not fail…
