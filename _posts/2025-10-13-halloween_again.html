<p>     I remember like it was yesterday, the fall of 2018</p>

<p>  Hopeful,         Fun, Spooky,       And gone.</p>

<p> A time of interest that has long since faded with betrayal and fear.</p>

<p> But that time was spent  exploring,  and these new, dark horizons</p>

<p>    welcome me with comfort as I see them once more.</p>

<p>            I want to remember.</p>

<p>           I want to have fun again.</p>

<p>          Happy  Spooky  Season.</p>
