Writing is hard. Everything has to be just perfect, except it really doesn't.<!-- excerpt --> Sometimes, you can [just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) write whatever thoughts come to your mind. Often times, it — This can be done without deleting previous thoughts by using [dashes](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/handwriting/), helping to — which helps avoid the need to constantly rephrase what's being said as is pops onto the page. The text can be short, meaningless, and random, or it can be long, meaningful, and purposeful. The point is, whatever comes out is good. Or at least good enough to be published. This post probably has several overlooked/incorrect grammar/coherence mistakes, but I don't care. I'm just — imagining I'm talking to a — to someone about — as if I'm having a conversation.

Most of the time I write, I always — I get into the habit writing, re-reading, re-writing, adjusting, re-arranging, etc. This can be tiring and unnecessary, especially when only about three people will even see my posts, these people being some that I interact with on a mostly daily basis anyway. This is probably a good skill for academic/professional writing, but for some little blog post?

I haven't published in a while, not because I don't want to, but because I haven't written anything that is up to some invisible standard in my brain. But you know what, who cares. I can write what I want! I can write about whatever I want! I can make it — It doesn't have to be an invisibly good as some part of my brain wants it to be to be able to go on some random — tiny little website! I'll express myself however I want, brain! Let me publish!

Just — Write whatever comes to mind — **[Get started](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogardenite/writing/escape/velocity/)**.
