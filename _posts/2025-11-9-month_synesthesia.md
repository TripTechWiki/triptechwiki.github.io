Recently, I watched [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHKUcB2gNJ8) on color associations that people have with months of the year. Before it got into the data, I took a second to think about what colors I associate with months (given the colors presented at the start of the video) and wrote them down here:
<!-- excerpt -->

| Month     | Color         | Reason                        |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| January   | Cyan          | Winter / Snow                 |
| February  | Red Pink      | Valentines Day                |
| March     | Light Green   | Start of spring               |
| April     | Light Cyan    | Spring                        |
| May       | Pink          | End of spring                 |
| June      | Sky Blue      | Summer                        |
| July      | Yellow        | Summer / Heat                 |
| August    | Light Brown   | End of summer / Start of fall |
| September | Yellow Orange | Fall                          |
| October   | Orange        | Halloween                     |
| November  | Dark Brown    | Fall / Thanksgiving           |
| December  | Dark Green    | Christmas                     |

I didn't quite like the limited choices for the fall months, so I added light and dark brown for August and November rather than having both be brown. They are distinct!

My choices ended up being more or less the same as what most people thought, which makes sense due to the holidays and season associations. The biggest surprise was most people thinking December is white?? What? That never would have crossed my mind! How are so few people voting green?

To be clear, I am NOT really synesthetic in any way as far as I can tell. The only thing that comes to mind is that I often describe different kinds of sweetness, bitterness, or other flavors with high or low pitches in my mind, but I'm not sure if that's quite the same thing.

Anyway, I think synesthesia is really cool, and I'm not sure how to end this post! Thanks for reading!
