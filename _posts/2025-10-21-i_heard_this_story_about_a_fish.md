I heard this story about a fish...

He swims up to this older fish and says, "I'm trying to find this thing they call the ocean."

"The ocean?", says the older fish, "That's what you're in right now!"

"This?", says the young fish, "This is water... What I *want* is the ocean."

â€” *Soul* (2020)

I watched Soul about a month ago, and I'm not sure why but this quote really stuck out to me. Well, the whole movie stuck out to me to be honest. It just kinda hit different. I cried a little bit. Life is good.
