"When a person has extreme social anxiety, they struggle to communicate with others. Bear in mind, they only struggle to form connections. It doesn't mean they don't want to."

— *Komi Can't Communicate* (2021–2022)

Not much more to say this time, other than the fact that I binged Komi Can't Communicate a couple of months ago :3 The show is really cute, and the stereotypes of the characters are hilarious. I'm a little sad that [the anime ended after only covering about a quarter of the manga](https://komisan.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_24), but it's okay I guess. The quote above is featured at the beginning of the episodes, and I think it's quite eloquent.
