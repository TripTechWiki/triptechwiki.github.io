<p>At long last, the blog is finally ready, just in time for the new year!</p>

<p>This year is extra special because 2025 is a <a href=https://oeis.org/A000290>perfect square</a>, as well as the sum of the first 9 <a href=https://oeis.org/A000537>cubic numbers</a>!
<!-- excerpt -->
<p>2025 is 45<sup>2</sup>. The last year to be a perfect square was 1936, which is 44<sup>2</sup>. That was 89 years ago! The next perfect square year will be 91 years from now in 2116, which is 46<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>2025 is also the sum of the first 9 cubic numbers, which means 1<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> + 4<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 6<sup>3</sup> + 7<sup>3</sup> + 8<sup>3</sup> + 9<sup>3</sup> = 2025. The last time this happened was 729 years ago in the year 1296, which is the sum of the first 8 cubic numbers. The next time will be for the sum of the first 10 cubic numbers in 3025, which is 1000 years from now!</p>
