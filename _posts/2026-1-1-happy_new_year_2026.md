It has officially been one year since the TripTech blog began! In that time, the blog has seen numerous improvements, such as better formatted pages, [an RSS feed](/blog/2025/11/12/blog_update_rss_feed.html), better last modified dates, and more! This year also held [the first BlogNov](/blog/2025/11/01/blog_nov_2025.html), whose success is rather subjective<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
<!-- excerpt -->
I didn't have much of a plan for what to put in this post, so I'll write down some goals so that I'm held responsible by the void.

This year, I would like to track my eating habits on my phone and perhaps also eat a little healthier. I don't think I'm necessarily eating *un*healthily, but I think I could certainly have a more varied diet. I'll try it for about a month or so to see how it goes.

I would also like to upload more videos to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiM5zDfUq7CTr6kA9Ovqmjg)! I've had a two part series recorded for a while, I just need to finish editing the second part and upload them. I want to try making some first play through & reaction type videos, similar to [About Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/@AboutOliver).

Why what? [Be SPECIFIC, Bob](https://youtu.be/Egzz5L1ZUZ0?t=46)! Soooo, I guess I'll turn these into [SMART goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) or something.

| 2026 Goals   | Track Eating                                                                                                                                                                                                | YouTube Videos                                                                                               |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Specific*   | Use the Samsung Health app to log meals whenever possible. At a minimum, all meals that I make myself should be logged, since I know all the ingredients.                                                   | Upload at least 8 videos this year of any length. This includes the 2 that are already recorded plus 6 more. |
| *Measurable* | The number of days / meals I log.                                                                                                                                                                           | The number of YouTube videos I upload.                                                                       |
| *Acheivable* | It should only take a couple of minutes to log a meal, which should speed up over time as I figure out the app and save meal presets. I can also scan barcodes instead of looking everything up every time. | This equates to recording one video every two months, and editing it in between.                             |
| *Relevant*   | Eat healthier and vary my diet.                                                                                                                                                                             | I've been wanting to upload videos for fun for a while, but haven't taken the time to.                       |
| *Time-bound* | Start with one month to see how it goes, then see if I should keep tracking longer.                                                                                                                         | One year.                                                                                                    |

That seems pretty good! I'll probably post some updates about those in the future.

I also want to add more features to the site at some point, such as a better search function and some basic page statistics, not to mention actually getting the [Minecraft](/minecraft.html) and [Project](/directory.html) pages running! Those pages have been parked for long enough. (Editor's Note: It appears that tables also need to be worked on, but that's a project for another day.)

I'm excited to have a wonderful 2026! Happy New Year!
