Today, I finally added a proper [RSS feed](https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/) to the site! Turns out it was just as easy as copying and pasting an example feed, then making a couple modifications.

The feed should contain the title, author, and excerpt of each post (usually just the first paragraph), as well as a temporary logo image and tag list for readers that support those things.

If for some reason your reader is having trouble finding the feed, [here is the direct link](https://triptechwiki.github.io/feed.xml).

Now you'll never miss a post again!
