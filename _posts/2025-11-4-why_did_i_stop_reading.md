In elementary school and middle school, I used to read all the time. Mostly fiction, but also just whatever other books we got from the library that week. We used to go to the library just about every week to find new books. I used to work on all sorts of projects as well. One that comes to mind is origami. I knew the origami section in the library by heart. I even had the decimals for a couple sections I liked memorized so that I could find them quicker.

<!-- excerpt -->

Once I started high school, I got my own computer. I stopped reading as much. Covid happened. I got into video games more. I discovered how vast YouTube really was.

Now, some years after high school, I still read sometimes. I have to make time to do so; the desire doesn't come automatically. But ever since I stopped reading, I feel less creative. Less enthralled by the possibilities of reality, but by the infinite nature of the internet.

And so, an array of keys and a laser edits and transforms a non-tangible reality, disconnected from this world.

Sometimes, I wish I could go back.

So I do! Recently, I've been really trying to get back into some of my old hobbies, like reading, cross-stitching, photography, hiking, and more! I'm slowly making a difference that I'm proud of.

"The best thing I ever learned was how to read."
