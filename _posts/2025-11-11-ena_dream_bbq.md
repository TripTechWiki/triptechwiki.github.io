Last night, I played [ENA: Dream BBQ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2134320/ENA_Dream_BBQ/) for the first time, recommended by TNTeck1! It's a sort of surreal adventure where you talk to a bunch of people and complete tasks. I got through the first chapter of the game (I think I got a bad ending), and it was incredible.

First off, I'd never heard of ENA until just a few days ago. Apparently there's some other animated stuff, but I haven't seen any of it.

Second off, ENA: Dream BBQ is AMAZING. Imagine all the art styles crammed into one wonderful concoction! 2D, 3D, high-res, low-res, detailed, simple, IT'S ALL THERE. The environments really reminded me of the [Meow Wolf exhibitions](https://meowwolf.com) and the [Museum of Other Realities](https://store.steampowered.com/app/613900/Museum_of_Other_Realities/). On top of that, add a bunch of different languages, story, humor, and nonsense. I'm really excited to keep playing and unraveling the mysteries of the story.

ALSO, the game is totally free, so you might as well try it out.
